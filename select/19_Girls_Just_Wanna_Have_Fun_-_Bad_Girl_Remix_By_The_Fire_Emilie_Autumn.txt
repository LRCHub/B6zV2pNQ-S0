I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mummy dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My doctor yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh doctor dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all we really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

Girls, they want
They wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun

When the working day is done

That's all we really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna

When the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna
