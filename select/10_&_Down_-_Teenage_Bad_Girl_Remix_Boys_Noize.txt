Shut Down
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Two cool sharps standin" side by side
Yeah, my fuel injected stingray and a four-thirteen
Were revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean

Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

Declinin' numbers at an even rate
At the count of one we both accelerate
My stingray is light the slicks are startin' to spin
But the four-thirteen's really diggen' in

Gotta be cool now power shift here we go

Superstock dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel injected stingray's really startin' to go
I'm gettin' the traction i'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin' that machine's too much

Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
He's powered by ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood

Shut it off, shut it off buddy now i shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now i shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now i shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now i shut you down
